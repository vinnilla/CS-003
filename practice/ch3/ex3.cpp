Assignment: Blackjack Hand Scorer
Programming Project 4: 3_P_4_Blackjack. see more on Canvas.

Write a program that scores a blackjack hand. In blackjack, a player receives from two to five cards. 
The cards 2 through 10 are scored as 2 through 10 points each. The face cardsâ€”jack, queen, and 
kingâ€”are scored as 10 points. The goal is to come as close to a score of 21 as possible without 
going over 21. Hence, any score over 21 is called "busted." The ace can count as either 1 or 11, 
whichever is better for the user.

Input Format:
- First line: Number of cards (2-5)
- Following lines: One card value per line
  Valid inputs: 2-9, T (for 10), J, Q, K, A (case sensitive)
- After each hand: Prompt "Continue? (y/n)"

Output Format:
- Score of the hand as an integer
- "Busted" if score exceeds 21

Example Interaction:

How many cards? [4]
card: [x]
card: [x]
card: [x]
card: [x]

Total Score: XX

continue? (Y/N) [Y]

How many cards? [5]
card: [x]
card: [x]
card: [x]
card: [x]
card: [x]

Busted

continue? (Y/N) [n]
