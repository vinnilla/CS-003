Practice Programs #2: 3.E2 Rock Paper Scissors. See Canvas for more

Write a program to score the paper-rock-scissor game. Each of two users types 
in either P, R, or S. The program then announces the winner as well as the basis
for determining the winner: Paper covers rock,Rock breaks scissors,Scissors cut 
paper,or Nobody wins. Be sure to allow the users to use lowercase as well as 
uppercase letters. Your program should include a loop that lets the user play 
again until the user says she or he is done.
use these prompts: 

Player 1: Enter P, R, or S: 
Player 2: Enter P, R, or S:

announce who won by this output:
Player 1 wins
or 
Player 2 wins

Example Interactions:

Player1: [p]
Player2: [R]
Player 2 wins

Play again? (y/n): [Y]

Player1: [R]
Player2: [r]
Nobody wins

Play again? (y/n): [y]

Player1: [s]
Player2: [P]
Player 1 wins

Play again? (y/n): [n]
